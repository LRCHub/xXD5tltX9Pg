You had my heart
And we'll never be a world apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
You will see shiny cars
And thats when you'll need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shines
We shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath
I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that's it rainin' more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh

Fancy things
Their never comin' in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took it's part
When the world has dealt it's cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shines
We shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath
I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that's it rainin' more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
So gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

When the sun shines
We shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath
I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that's it rainin' more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my

(Umbrella, ella ella eh eh eh)
