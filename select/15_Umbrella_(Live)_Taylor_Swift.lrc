[00:24.50] You have my heart
[00:27.62] We'll never be worlds apart
[00:29.91] Maybe in magazines
[00:32.93] But you'll still be my star
[00:35.70] Baby cause in the dark
[00:38.66] You can see shiny cars
[00:41.92] That's when you need me there
[00:44.93] With you I'll always share
[00:47.95] Because
[00:51.45] 
[00:49.71] When the sun shines
[00:51.22] We'll shine together
[00:52.74] Told you I'll be here forever
[00:55.50] Said I'll always be your friend
[00:58.54] Took an oath
[00:59.72] I'mma stick it out 'till the end
[01:01.98] Now that it's raining more than ever
[01:04.71] Know that we'll still have each other
[01:07.74] You can stand under my umbrella
[01:10.72] You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella
[01:15.54] Eh yeah eh
[01:18.32] Under my umbrella, ella, ella eh, eh, eh, eh, eh eh
