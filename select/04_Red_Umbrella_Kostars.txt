Through the window I hear the rain
It reminds me of you
The sounds of the drops
Caress me as sweetly as you

On my pillow my eyes fill with tears
And I'm here feeling blue
Call me crazy but I can't stop thinking
Of how you could never be true

Still miss you
Even though you done me wrong
Still miss you
It's been much too long
I thought I could find another fella
But all I want to see is
Your red umbrella

You walk by my door
You always would knock there before
But tonight you walk on
I guess our love isn't that strong

I try to erase
All the days that I looked
At your face
With love in my eyes
Your leaving was such a surprise

Still miss you
Even though you done me wrong
Still miss you
It's been much too long
I thought I could find another fella
But all I want to see is
Your red umbrella.
