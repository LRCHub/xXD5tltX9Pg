```
No clouds in my storms
Let it rain
I hydroplane into fame
Come'n down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone
We Rocafella
She fly higher than weather
And she rocks it better
You know me
An anticipation
for precipitation
stacks chips for the rainy day
Jay rain man is back
with lil Ms Sunshine
Rihanna where you at
You had my heart
and we'll never be world apart
Maybe in magazines
but you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the Dark
You can see shiny Cars
And that's
when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath Imma stick
it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining
more than ever
Know that we still
have each other
You can stand
under my Umbrella
You can stand
under my Umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
These fancy things
will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for Infinity
When the war has took it's part
When the world has dealt
it's cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath Imma stick it out
till the end
Now that it's raining
more than ever
Know that we still
have each other
You can stand
under my Umbrella
You can stand
under my Umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
You can run into my Arms
It's okay don't be alarmed
Come into Me
There's no distance in
between our love
So Gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because
When the sun shines
We'll shine Together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath Imma stick
it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining
more than ever
Know that we still
have each other
You can stand
under my Umbrella
You can stand
under my Umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
